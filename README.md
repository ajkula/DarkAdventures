# DarkAdventures
A simple text adventure game I build in Go for fun...

## Installation
It's as simple as clone/compile/run...

You might want to **go get**:
 - github.com/fatih/color
 - github.com/cloudfoundry/jibber_jabber

There are a few steps to make the experience much better however:
 - GDrive URL to download the game:
 **https://tinyurl.com/y4v69bsn**
 - I recommend using a terminal emulator on windows such as: 
 **https://conemu.github.io/en/TableOfContents.html**
 - The software will create the default *landscape layout*, it has only a weak contextual influence for the moment but will have more depth later.
 - If the software was started *directly* it might close the console abruptly on exit, I therefore recommend opening the terminal and start the application from it.
 - By default the game will get the O/S language

## How to use
